# screenshotter

That is a little project to take screenshots.
Plan is to have several options to make a full screenshot of all screens, of just the main screen, of a specific screen. Saving of the Screenshots for now will be in the const Variable PATH which one will have to add by its own. It can be in any file:

const val PATH = "c:\\"

The name of the screenshot JPEG will be 500.jpg or any other number when provided via commandline.
